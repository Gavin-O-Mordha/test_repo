If not using the built-in inventory addtion feature, the format is:
"Book name", "Author", amount of books that are currently available, amount of books that are currently borrowed
The names should be incased in quotation marks and all amounts must be number values (integer to be specific)

Book_inventory.txt MUST have a empty line at the end of the file

other than that, the entire program needs no other setup to run perfectly
